# What is this repository?
This repository includes the four cases adressed in Smart Sustainability Simulation Game, a cross-university lecture held at the University of Hohenheim, the University of Bayreuth and the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences. 
Each case is represented by one folder and consists of two weeks. In the folders, you will find Worksheets for each week that explain your task for the week. Additionally, the data and code files help you find a solution to the task. 

During the Simulation Game, we will upload all relevant data for you to solve the cases. 

# Self Test
In the self test folder, you will find a short task for you to find out if Smart Sustainability Simulation Game is the right lecture for you.
Try to solve the case and test your own knowledge!
